        The Island Slide Puzzle doesn't gather any data. No privacy-sensitive or any other data.
        </p>
        <p>
        The apps work completely offline and the website only downloads the data that's needed to run the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only data that is gathered on the backend is the amount of data downloaded and installed apps.
